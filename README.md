JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide
What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a popular, high-level, interpreted programming language. It's primarily used to create interactive web pages, but it can also be used for server-side programming, game development, and more.

Key Features of JavaScript:

Dynamic Typing: Variables can hold values of any data type, and their type can change during runtime.
Object-Oriented Programming: JavaScript supports object-oriented concepts like objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript is well-suited for asynchronous operations, allowing it to handle tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: JavaScript runs in web browsers on various operating systems, making it highly versatile.
